# Depression_Analysis

Data Analytics 
Project Proposal:

A deep dive into understanding the relationship between the measure of heart rate variability and its affect on your level of depression.

Heart rate variability has been shown in the scientific literature to be related to one's level of depression. This measure can play a key role in assesing the mental health of an individual.

We will be using an NIH dataset filled with questionnaire survey data that classifies depression from a 1-6 scale.

We will be using classification as the main Machine Learning component of our project. Please see the jupyter notebook to observe the data cleaning for the dataset and machine learning methods we are intending to use.
